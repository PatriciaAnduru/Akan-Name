        <h1>Akan Names</h1>
    <p>In many parts of Ghana, and elsewhere in West Africa, a person’s name is determined by the day of the week on which she/he was born.Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names.</p>
    <p>Enter your birthdate and gender below to read and hear your day name in Ashanti Twi, a dialect of Akan and the most widely spoken language in Ghana:</p>
